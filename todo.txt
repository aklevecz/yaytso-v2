two polygon NFTs

differentiate cartons from mainnet to polygon
differentiate nfts from mainnet to polygon
differentiate txs from mainnet to polygon

newly created polygon NFTs will overwrite the mainnet ones in the firestore db
 - needs to be different db keys

 CARTON 1 has been overrwritten by polygon
